      <p><em>My dearest Darshan,</em></p>

      <p>
        As you reach another beautiful year of your life, I just want to pause the world for a moment and tell you how deeply I love you.
      </p>

      <p>
        You are not just the reason I smileâ€¦  
        You are the reason I believe in magic, in forever, in soulmates.  
        With every heartbeat, youâ€™ve filled my world with laughter, comfort, and unconditional love.
      </p>

      <p>
        Youâ€™ve seen me at my best and held me through my worst.  
        Youâ€™ve been my biggest support, my warmest hug, and my safest home.  
        No gift, no word, no surprise can ever match what youâ€™ve given me:  
        <strong>Your love. Your heart. Your everything.</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Today is your special day, but truthfullyâ€¦  
        <strong>Every day with you feels like a celebration.</strong><br/>
        Your smile makes my world brighter.  
        Your laugh is my favorite sound.  
        Your heart? Itâ€™s my forever home.
      </p>

      <p>
        So here's to you â€”  
        To the man who changed my life in the most beautiful way.  
        To my best friend, my heartbeat, my forever.  
        To <em>us.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Happy Birthday, my love.  
        May every wish you make tonight come trueâ€¦  
        Because <strong>you are</strong> the dream I wished for â€” and somehow, I got lucky enough to live it.
      </p>
